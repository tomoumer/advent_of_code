# Advent Of Code

This repository is for solving the https://adventofcode.com problems.

I'll be using Python.

As per author [Eric Wastl's request](https://adventofcode.com/2015/about), the files here will just contain the actual code and maybe some thought processes, but not the data or text from the web.
